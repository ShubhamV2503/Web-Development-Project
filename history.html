                    The Nizam made the British engineers begin the survey work for this dam across the Krishna River in the year 1903.

The project's construction was officially inaugurated by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 10 December 1955 and proceeded for the next twelve years. Raja Vasireddy Ramagopala Krishna Maheswara Prasad, popularly known as late Muktyala Raja, was instrumental in the construction of the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam through active political lobbying and the donation of one hundred million British pounds and fifty-five thousand acres of land. It was the tallest masonry dam in the world at that time, built entirely with local know-how under the engineering leadership of Kanuri Lakshmana Rao.

The reservoir water was released into the left and right bank canals by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on August 4, 1967.Construction of the hydroelectric power plant followed, with power generation increasing between 1978 and 1985 as additional units came into service. In 2015, diamond jubilee celebrations of project's inauguration were held, alluding to the prosperity the dam has ushered into the region.

The construction of the dam submerged an ancient Buddhist settlement, Nagarjunakonda, which was the capital of the Ikshvaku dynasty in the 1st and 2nd centuries and the successors of the Satavahanas in the Eastern Deccan. Excavations there yielded 30 Buddhist monasteries as well as artwork and inscriptions of historical importance. Prior to the reservoir's flooding, monuments were dug up and relocated. Some were moved to Nagarjunakonda, now an island in the middle of the reservoir. Others were moved to the nearby mainland village of Anupu.

The artificial lift irrigation based diversion of the river from its natural delta area into Nalgonda district caused erosion of the fluorine-rich volcanic rocks in Nalgonda and contaminated its groundwater supply. It also caused uncertain flows of water into the Krishna river delta area and a shrinkage of the natural wonder "The Kolleru Lake".The use of erosion resistant canals interfered with the natural silting process of a river to the deltas and created long-term ecological issues to the health of the delta lands. Reduced flows into the sea resulted in land salination and sea encroachment of coastal lands in Diviseema. The diversion of Krishna water for 200Â km to Hyderabad resulted in massive evaporation losses especially in summer and reduced the size of Krishna river. Many forest preserves along the natural Krishna flow are now categorized as "completely degraded" forest areas. Krishna river once home to an ecological wonderland of fresh water fish and aquatic population is now completely depopulated. The river stopped being navigable since the year of Nagarjuna sagar construction.
